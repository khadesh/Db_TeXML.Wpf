  To add replaceable markers use the following syntax:
  %i%
  Where i is an integer starting at 0 and then incrementing by 1 for each index you wish to add.
  
  An example would be:
  <message 
    key="Sample" 
    value="%0% cannot be added to the database, you have %1% more tries."
  />
  
  This statement can be filled as follows:
  MessageParser["Sample", new string[] {"Test User", "2"}]
  To produce:
  "Test User cannot be added to the database, you have 2 more tries."
